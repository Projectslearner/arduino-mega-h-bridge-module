# H-Bridge Module

#### Project Overview

The H-Bridge Module project demonstrates how to control a DC motor bidirectionally using an H-Bridge module with an Arduino Mega. An H-Bridge is a circuit that allows DC motors to be driven both forward and backward by controlling the polarity of the voltage applied to the motor terminals. This project utilizes three digital pins on the Arduino to control motor direction and enable/disable motor operation.

#### Components Needed

1. **Arduino Mega**
2. **H-Bridge Motor Driver Module (e.g., L298N)**
3. **DC Motor**
4. **Power Supply (e.g., 12V battery or adapter)**
5. **Jumper Wires**

#### Block Diagram


#### Circuit Setup

1. **Connect the H-Bridge Module to Arduino Mega and Motor:**
   - **Motor Terminal 1** (e.g., OUT1) to **Motor Pin 1** (e.g., motorPin1)
   - **Motor Terminal 2** (e.g., OUT2) to **Motor Pin 2** (e.g., motorPin2)
   - **Enable Pin** (e.g., ENA) to **Enable Pin** (e.g., enablePin)
   - **Power Supply** (e.g., +12V and GND) to the H-Bridge module for motor operation

#### Instructions

1. **Install Required Libraries:**
   - No external libraries are required for this project.

2. **Circuit Setup:**
   - Connect the H-Bridge module to the Arduino Mega and DC motor as described in the circuit setup section.

3. **Code Upload:**
   - Open the Arduino IDE and create a new sketch.
   - Copy and paste the provided Arduino code into the sketch.

4. **Testing:**
   - Upload the code to the Arduino Mega.
   - Open the serial monitor in Arduino IDE (set to 9600 baud) to observe motor direction messages.
   - The DC motor should alternate between moving forward and backward in 2-second intervals.

#### Applications

- **Robotics:** Control motors in robotic applications for movement and positioning.
- **Automation:** Drive mechanical systems such as conveyor belts or actuators.
- **DIY Projects:** Integrate motor control into various hobbyist projects requiring motion control.
- **Educational Purposes:** Learn about motor control principles and H-Bridge operation.

#### Notes

- Ensure the power supply voltage matches the motor and H-Bridge module specifications.
- Adjust the delay times in the `loop()` function to change the duration of motor movement and stop periods.
- Modify the code and hardware setup for driving multiple motors or different types of motors (e.g., stepper motors) with appropriate H-Bridge modules.
